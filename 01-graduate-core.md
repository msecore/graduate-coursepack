## MAT`_`SCI 401: Chemical & Statistical Thermodynamics

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Course Description:**

The purpose of this course is to introduce the principles of statistical thermodynamics and to demonstrate how it provides quantitative understanding of a broad range of phenomena in materials science, including phase equilibria, the behavior of solutions and mixtures, kinetics, etc. The course provides a important foundation for subsequent courses in Materials Science and Engineering as well as future research in a wide range of areas. The following topics in classical thermodynamics will be covered:

1. The laws of thermodynamics; conditions for equilibrium (ref: Topic401-1)
2. Solutions (ref: Topic401-2)
3. Excess quantities (ref: Topic401-3)
4. Binary and ternary phase diagrams (ref: Topic401-4)
5. Statistical definition of entropy (ref: Topic401-5)
6. Ensembles and the Boltzmann and Gibbs distributions (ref: Topic401-6)
7. Quantum and classical ideal gasses (ref: Topic401-7)
8. The regular solution model (ref: Topic401-8)

## MAT\_SCI 402: Structure of Crystalline and Non-crystalline Materials

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Course Description**

This course centers on the methods of describing both crystalline and non-crystalline materials, as well as addresses the underlying relationships of materials and their structures. Symmetry principles and tensor representations of crystal properties will be used to describe, for example, transport behavior, elasticity, displacement phase transitions, and material anisotropy. Topics in non-crystalline solids include theories and models of amorphousness, as well as influence of ordering in hard and soft condensed matter systems such as glasses and polymers.

1. Symmetry Principles, Point, Plane, and Space Groups (ref: Topic402-1)
2. Crystallographic Descriptors and Structure (ref: Topic402-2)
3. Material Anisotropy (ref: Topic402-3)
4. Displacive Phase Transitions (ref: Topic402-4)
5. Tensors and Constitutive Relations (ref: Topic402-5)
6. Sphere Packing and Non-crystalline Solids (ref: Topic402-6)
7. Polymer Chemistry and Architecture (ref: Topic402-7)
8. Molecular Order in Soft Condensed Matter (ref: Topic402-8)
