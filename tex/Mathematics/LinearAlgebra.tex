\subsection{Linear Algebra}

Linear algebra is a branch of mathematics that is central to physical description in Materials Science as it concerns the description of vectors spaces and is used in solving systems of equations. Materials Science graduate students will encounter application of linear algebra in all core courses. The sections below outline basic linear algebra concepts. \ignore{Refer to \ref{App:AppendixB} for}
