\section{Mathematics}

The text below is not a rigorous approach to the mathematical theory, nor is it a wholly systematic or comprehensive description of the topics covered. It is a selection of topics recommended by core instructors. These include mathematical concepts and procedures that will be encountered in your core courses, and instructors expect you to be familiar with them prior to the beginning of a course, i.e, they will not cover them in detail. Instead, use the content below as a reference as these topics arise and as a platform for more in-depth study. Please contact \href{mailto:jonathan.emery@northwestern.edu}{jonathan.emery@northwestern.edu} with suggestions for additional material to be included in this section.

For those who have never seen the mathematics below or who are not comfortable with the material, further preparation may be necessary. Options for those students include: either a.) enroll in ES-APPM-311-1 and ES-APPM-311-2: Methods of Applied Mathematics and/or b.) utilizing the suggested resources for supplemental study.
